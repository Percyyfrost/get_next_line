disinfected curtains,
beyond touch of sunrise
devouring the terrible gold

of leaves, a man could be
his own eternal night. City
flattened to rubble, his

surviving height a black flight
of notes: the chip-toothed
blade and oldest anesthetic.

Escaped convict, he climbs
wild-eyed, one hand out—
running its twin on the rails

of a broken Steinway. Who
has not been found guilty
of a carrion cry—the dream

of a feathered departure
one has not earned, then fall
back down teeming fault lines

of the flesh? Memory recedes
into nocturne, a kingdom born
of spruce and fading light—

he reaches in the end what
he had to begin with: fingertips
on corrupted tissue, cathedral

of octaves in his thinning
breath, tears like small stubborn
gods refusing to fall.
